# Complex_Numbers
A Java Class that specialises in dealing with Complex Numbers.

This class allows for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division between complex numbers and other complex numbers.
It also allows the same operations between complex numbers and rational numbers.
Furthermore, this class implements modulus and argument methods. 

The method trigForm() returns the trigonometric form of a complex number as a String as follows:
"z = r * (cos a + i * sin a)", where r = mod(z) and a = arg(z).
